# PythonAI
A python AI bot in discord using Ollama. To utilize this, view the comments in the Python file, or read a summary here.

To start, install Ollama and install the bot youd like to use by typing it in the terminal. (something like `ollama run llama3.3`). 
Once it loads, close the terminal window so it stops the bot.
Next, create a bot with all possible intents.
Grab the key and put it in the botkey variable.
On the Oauth page, only check the bot tab.
Next invite it to your server with admin permissions.

Set the botkey variable to your bots token (the secret code you get upon creation.)
Now, run the Ollama app. Don't start any models just make sure it shows in task manager. 
Then finally, run the Python file!

> [!CAUTION]
> Do **NOT** share your bot token with anyone! This is very important!
